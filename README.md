# Sudhaar - The Project for Social Innovation
### Overview    

Sudhaar is a step toward creating a better world with better grievance redressal mechanisms. The ideology is simple:
- Someone has an issue to be resolved.
- S/he submits a request on our web/android-app for resolution.
- The request is sent to the central Police Control Room.
- An Electronic FIR gets lodged in the name of the suspect (if known).
- Our team proceeds with international standards to protect the identity of victim(s).
- The redressal committee oversees the request and continues with quick redressal.
